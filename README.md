## At first ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! This is each of repositories introduced about something, such as career, the topics I like/use ordinary, hobby, etc.
So, I'm going to write down it on this board. At the same time, I'm going to pick up it on this README.md in the future.

In addition to the content like above, I'm thinking that I try to continue to push up some repository related tech topic in order to output on my own skill and connect with other engineers to exchange opinions!

So, If you feel it's good, plaese follow! Take it easy!
Thank you for coming in my repository and reading untill final. Best regards from now on!

## About me.

Recently, I use React, TypeScript and Golang. In addition, I have had the experience that use another program languages, such as PHP, Python.

I live in Tokyo. Of cause, I usually work there. In the future, I hope to work some foreign countries to experience the difference compared with Japanese.
