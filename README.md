## At first ðŸ‘‹

This is a my repository introducing my information.
For example, career, the topic I like/use ordinary, my hobby, etc, I'm going to deal with those content on this README.md in the future.

In addition to the content like above, I'm thinking that I try to continue to push up a tech repository in order to connect with other engineers to exchange opinions.

Thank you for reading, and best regards from now on!
